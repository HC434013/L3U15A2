## Design Choice Justification
## Design Concept 1

### Pros
- Heavy blend of images and text to deliver information pertaining to the purpose
### Drawbacks
- Could be seen as a stylistic/multimedia overload
- Could be poor for optimisation to have a lot of images loaded at once

## Design Concept 2 (chosen)

### Pros
- Directly draws attention to site purpose, stating that the organisation is looking for new hires
- Subtle blend of images and text to deliver information matching the purpose 
- Lessened use of images compared to design 1 helps site optimisation by reducing the amount of potentially heavy assets to load
### Drawbacks
- Could be seen as a little too barebones, but I personally disagree

These 2 designs were peer-evaluated, and Design 2 was favored over Design 1, as it was seen as a slight overuse of images and that less could be used to convey what the client wants in the website. Other peer suggested tweaks include the addition of a background photo over the main call to action and slight changes to the "About us" section.

## Testing, Optimisation & Compatibility

During development, I devised a simple test plan that matches the minimalist nature of the website. When testing the website, I would load every page from a version deployed on GitHub Pages and click every available button to ensure they redirected correctly, and double check each image to ensure they would load in a very short time. Loading time was never a problem as the site is pretty barebones even in concept and my use of Bootstrap resulted in a highly optimised end product. Despite this result, I did ensure the images used were in a compressed state as standard for webpages.

Additionally, I would test the pages similarly on a mobile device to ensure the layout was correct and all aspects of the site were as accessible on a phone as they are on a desktop.

## Final Product

The final product fulfils client requirements by containing:

- A profile of the company itself and description of what they do that is marketable to potential clients and employees
- Profiles of existing trainee web developers
- Job specifications and required qualifications
- An online contact form intended for inquiries and employee applications
- References to online web development courses outlined as a recommended job specification

Audience requirements are also fulfilled; as the site acts as a profile for a company that the target audience (a web developer looking for work) can use to decide on applying for work at this organisation.
